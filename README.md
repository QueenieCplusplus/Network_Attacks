# Eavesdropping, 竊聽

this attack is particularly easy in wireless LANs, where no physical connections are necessary, and it is advantageous for an attacke to remain invisible (unaddressable) on the network.

* Prevention

(1) Encrption on network level or app level

(2) Traffic padding to prevent identify time

(3) Reroute to anonymize its origin

(4) Mandate trusted routed for data (the info is only traversing trusted network domain)
